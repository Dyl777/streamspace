docs: add shutdown procedures, port-forward instructions, navigation links, and remove all emojis

Add shutdown/cleanup procedures and port-forwarding instructions
to documentation files based on user testing on Windows with
Docker Desktop. Add navigation links to help users find the right
documentation for their use case (end user, developer, local testing).
Remove all emojis from all documentation files per AI_RULES.txt.

Changes:
- Add "Stopping StreamSpace" sections with 7 shutdown methods
- Add port-forward instructions with multiple scenarios
- Add platform-specific commands (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- Add monitoring stack cleanup procedures
- Add cross-references between documentation files
- Add "Choose Your Path" navigation sections in README and QUICKSTART
- Remove all emojis from 100+ documentation files (AI_RULES.txt compliance)

Files Modified:
- README.md: navigation links and developer access sections
- QUICKSTART.md: navigation links and port-forward instructions
- TESTING.md: shutdown guide (primary reference)
- scripts/LOCAL_TESTING.md: local development procedures
- NEXT_STEPS_GUIDE.md: user-tested commands (removed emojis)
- All .md files in root, docs/, tests/, ui/, k8s-controller/, .claude/, plugins/, site/, manifests/

Navigation Added:
- End Users: QUICKSTART.md for installation and usage
- Developers: CONTRIBUTING.md for development setup
- Local Testing: TESTING.md and scripts/LOCAL_TESTING.md

Shutdown Methods:
1. Quick Stop - Delete namespace

3. Individual Components - Stop specific services
4. Complete Cleanup - Remove CRDs
