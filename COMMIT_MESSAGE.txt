docs: add comprehensive shutdown procedures and port-forward instructions

Added detailed shutdown/cleanup procedures and port-forwarding instructions
to all major documentation files based on user testing on Windows with
Docker Desktop.

Changes:
- Added "Stopping StreamSpace" sections with 7 shutdown methods
- Enhanced port-forward instructions with multiple scenarios
- Included platform-specific commands (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- Added monitoring stack cleanup procedures
- Cross-referenced documentation for easy navigation

Files Modified:
- TESTING.md: Complete shutdown guide (primary reference)
- QUICKSTART.md: Quick reference with port-forward details
- README.md: Developer access and shutdown sections
- scripts/LOCAL_TESTING.md: Local development procedures
- NEXT_STEPS_GUIDE.md: User-tested commands and examples

Shutdown Methods Added:
1. Quick Stop - Delete namespace (fastest)
2. Graceful Stop - Scale to zero (preserves config)
3. Individual Components - Stop specific services
4. Complete Cleanup - Remove everything including CRDs
5. Monitoring Stack - Stop Prometheus/Grafana
6. Port Forwards - Kill kubectl processes
7. Docker Desktop - Stop entire Kubernetes cluster

Port-Forward Enhancements:
- Clear instructions for UI, API, and session access
- Multiple terminal window examples
- Different local ports for multiple sessions
- Access URLs clearly documented
- Notes about keeping terminals open

Verified on:
- OS: Windows 10/11
- Shell: Git Bash (MINGW64)
- Kubernetes: Docker Desktop
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
