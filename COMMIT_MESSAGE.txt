docs: add shutdown procedures and port-forward instructions

Add shutdown/cleanup procedures and port-forwarding instructions
to documentation files based on user testing on Windows with
Docker Desktop.

Changes:
- Add "Stopping StreamSpace" sections with 7 shutdown methods
- Add port-forward instructions with multiple scenarios
- Add platform-specific commands (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- Add monitoring stack cleanup procedures
- Add cross-references between documentation files

Files Modified:
- TESTING.md: shutdown guide (primary reference)
- QUICKSTART.md: port-forward instructions
- README.md: developer access and shutdown sections
- scripts/LOCAL_TESTING.md: local development procedures
- NEXT_STEPS_GUIDE.md: user-tested commands

Shutdown Methods:
1. Quick Stop - Delete namespace
2. Graceful Stop - Scale to zero
3. Individual Components - Stop specific services
4. Complete Cleanup - Remove CRDs
5. Monitoring Stack - Stop Prometheus/Grafana
6. Port Forwards - Kill kubectl processes
7. Docker Desktop - Stop Kubernetes cluster

Port-Forward Instructions:
- UI, API, and session access
- Multiple terminal window examples
- Different local ports for multiple sessions
- Access URLs documented
- Notes about keeping terminals open

Tested on:
- OS: Windows 10/11
- Shell: Git Bash (MINGW64)
- Kubernetes: Docker Desktop
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
