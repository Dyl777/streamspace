docs: add shutdown procedures, port-forward instructions, and navigation links

Add shutdown/cleanup procedures and port-forwarding instructions
to documentation files based on user testing on Windows with
Docker Desktop. Add navigation links to help users find the right
documentation for their use case (end user, developer, local testing).

Changes:
- Add "Stopping StreamSpace" sections with 7 shutdown methods
- Add port-forward instructions with multiple scenarios
- Add platform-specific commands (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- Add monitoring stack cleanup procedures
- Add cross-references between documentation files
- Add "Choose Your Path" navigation sections in README and QUICKSTART

Files Modified:
- README.md: navigation links and developer access sections
- QUICKSTART.md: navigation links and port-forward instructions
- TESTING.md: shutdown guide (primary reference)
- scripts/LOCAL_TESTING.md: local development procedures
- NEXT_STEPS_GUIDE.md: user-tested commands (removed emojis)

Navigation Added:
- End Users: QUICKSTART.md for installation and usage
- Developers: CONTRIBUTING.md for development setup
- Local Testing: TESTING.md and scripts/LOCAL_TESTING.md

Shutdown Methods:
1. Quick Stop - Delete namespace
2. Graceful Stop - Scale to zero
3. Individual Components - Stop specific services
4. Complete Cleanup - Remove CRDs
5. Monitoring Stack - Stop Prometheus/Grafana
6. Port Forwards - Kill kubectl processes
7. Docker Desktop - Stop Kubernetes cluster

Port-Forward Instructions:
- UI, API, and session access
- Multiple terminal window examples
- Different local ports for multiple sessions
- Access URLs documented
- Notes about keeping terminals open

Tested on:
- OS: Windows 10/11
- Shell: Git Bash (MINGW64)
- Kubernetes: Docker Desktop
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
